== FTL `--check` mode POC

This solution levarages Ansible's `check_mode` to validate homework.

Basically the course writers provide a complete solution to each of their labs in the form of an Ansible Playbook.
The lab_checker.yml playbook then runs this in check mode. 
If all tasks are a SUCCESS then the lab can be considered sucessfully completed.
If any tasks are FAILED or CHANGED then the lab is not completed and the user is informed with an indication of where they failed.
