== Overview

This directory, which is searched by ansible via `roles_path` is for lab solvers
i.e. these roles are used to solve a lab.

=== Naming Conventions

Role names clearly need to specify what course and lab they solve. In addition 
they need to include a version. `web-servers` is not meaningful!


[source,yaml]
----
<course-title>-<version>-<lab-number>
