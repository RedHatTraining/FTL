== Overview

This directory, which is searched by ansible via `roles_path`, is for lab solvers
i.e. these roles are used to *solve* a lab, not to *grade* it..

=== Naming Conventions

Role names clearly need to specify what *course*, *version*, and *lab* they solve.
`web-servers` is not a meaningful name!


[source,yaml]
----
<course-title>-<version>-<lab-number>
