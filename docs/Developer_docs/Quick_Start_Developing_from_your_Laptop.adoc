== Overview

It is simple to deploy FTL directly from your laptop into a grader host. There is no
pre-requisite for the grader host to already have any FTL support in agnosticd or any
other deployer.

You will need:

* An inventory file:
** The `group` `grading_host`
** At least one member of that group - you can configure multiple
** Suitable ssh configuration if necessary - ansible will parse your `~/.ssh/config` by default
.Sample Inventory File

[grading_host:vars]
ansible_host                    = 3.217.15.76
ansible_user                    = student1
ansible_ssh_pass                = ansible

=== Steps

Assuming you are in the root directory of your FTL repo:

. Load the `ftl-injector` role into your repo
** A utility exists to do this: `devel/bin/setup-development-environment.sh`
. Push your commits (https://github.com/redhat-gpte-devopsautomation/FTL)
** To the branch of your choice
. Run the `setup-grading-host.yml` playbook:
+
[source,bash]
----
FTL $ ansible-playbook devel/setup-grading-host.yml \
  -i ../../ansible-engine-inventory \
  -e @devel/sample-vars.yml  \
  -e ftl_git_branch=my-branch
