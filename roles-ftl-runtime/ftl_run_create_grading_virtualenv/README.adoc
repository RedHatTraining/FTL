== Overview

The role `ftl_run_create_grading_virtualenv` creates a virtualenv on the grading
host to allow FTL to run in a known good and protected environment irrespective
of the state of the students machine.


=== Variables

It takes 2 variables set in defaults/main.yml

`virtual_env_home: /tmp/virtualenvs`

The home where the virtualenv will be created. /opt is used as /tmp does not
persist through reboots

`virtual_env_name: venv-ftl-grading`

Name of the virtualenv. *DON'T* override this, the student grading scripts will
be looking to activate this to run their grading playbooks.

=== Files: requirements.txt

This file is used to configure the virtualenv with:

* ansible
* All necessary python libraries. e.g.
** `boto`, `boto3` for AWS
** `winrm` for windows etc

It can be regenerated automatically. New libraries can be added, don't remove
existing libraries without validating that they are no longer in use.
